Example architecture for a SPA with scroll to anchor links and `scroll-snap-type: y mandatory`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and makes use of [react-router-hash-link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-hash-link) - thank you to Rafael Pedicini.
